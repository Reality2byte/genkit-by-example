  "plan": "Okay, here's the implementation plan for the \"Tool Calling UI\" demo, designed for clarity and ease of implementation by another agent:\n\n**1. What's Exciting/Interesting for the Developer?**\n\n*   **Visualizing Tool Responses:** Developers will be excited to see how tool calls can be visually represented in the UI, moving beyond just text outputs. This demo highlights how to take structured data from tool calls and create dynamic, informative UIs based on the type of data returned.\n*   **Practical Tool Call Example:** This demo provides a concrete and easily understandable example of how to define and use tools within a chatbot context, showing that they're not just theoretical concepts. It shows a tool with input and a tool with no input to showcase both use-cases.\n*   **End-to-End Tool Call Flow:** Developers can trace the complete cycle â€“ from user input to LLM tool call, tool execution, and UI update. The full request/response flow will be visible, providing a solid understanding of the mechanics of tool calling.\n*   **UI Integration:** The demo provides a tangible example of how LLMs can be incorporated within traditional web apps, making the power of Genkit more accessible to developers that may be unfamiliar with the tech.\n\n**2. UI Design**\n\nThe UI will be a single-column, vertically oriented layout perfect for a side panel. It should include:\n\n*   **Chat Input:** A text input field at the bottom of the panel for the user to enter their prompt. It should use a `shadcn/ui` `Input` component.\n*   **Chat Bubbles:** A scrollable area above the input field that displays the chat history.\n    *   User messages should appear as standard chat bubbles on one side.\n    *   LLM responses should appear as standard chat bubbles on the other side.\n    *   Tool responses should be rendered *inline* within the LLM response bubble using specific UI elements (see below).\n*   **`rollDice` Tool UI:** When the `rollDice` tool is called and returns a number, the response should be rendered as a large red die with the corresponding number of pips (dots) on its face.\n*   **`getWeather` Tool UI:** When the `getWeather` tool is called and returns weather data, the response should be displayed with:\n    *   The temperature shown numerically.\n    *   A weather icon from `lucide` (e.g., sun, cloud, rain, etc.) appropriate for the `sunny`, `cloudy`, `rainy`, etc. value returned.\n*   **Clear messages:** Both types of tool responses (die and weather) should have a clear label of what tool was used.\n\n**3. Configuration**\n\nThere should be a configuration section in its own React client component for this demo. It should allow the user to change the system message for the chat, which will be passed into the `ai.chat()` call in the `route.ts` file. The system message should be in a `<textarea>`, should default to 'You are a helpful AI that can get the weather and roll dice for the user.', and should update the chat messages to start with a fresh conversation.\n\n**4. Server-Side API Endpoint (`api/route.ts`)**\n\nThe endpoint will be responsible for handling the chat logic. It will be a standard `POST` request.\n\n*   **No Streaming:** This demo does not require streaming responses, a simple fetch request will be sufficient.\n*   **Initial Setup:**\n    *   Import the necessary Genkit functions.\n    *   Initialize Genkit with a model that supports tool calling (e.g., Gemini).\n    *   Define the `getWeather` tool:\n        *   `name`: \"getWeather\"\n        *   `description`: \"Gets the current weather in a given location\"\n        *   `inputSchema`: A Zod object with a required `location` property of type `string`.\n        *   `outputSchema`: A Zod object with `temperature` (number), and `condition` (string - sunny, cloudy, rainy etc)\n        *   The tool implementation should return fake data such as `{temperature: 72, condition: 'sunny'}`.\n    *    Define the `rollDice` tool:\n        * `name`: \"rollDice\"\n        * `description`: \"Rolls a six-sided die and returns the result\"\n        * `inputSchema`: An empty Zod object (since it doesn't need input)\n        * `outputSchema`: A Zod schema with a single number type.\n        * The tool implementation should return a random number between 1 and 6, inclusive.\n*   **POST Request Handling:**\n    *   Accept a `prompt` from the request body, a `messages` array of the previous messages, and a `system` string for the chat system message.\n    *   Create a new `ai.chat()` instance each time with the provided system message and tools: `[getWeather, rollDice]`.\n    *   Call `chat.send(prompt)` with the current prompt.\n    *   Return the `response.text` and `response.toolCalls` (if they exist) as a JSON response.\n        * The `toolCalls` property will be an array of objects with the `name` and `output` keys. This is how the frontend will know what tool was called and what the result was.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n*   **Error Handling:** The implementation should include basic error handling and show error messages in the UI when needed.\n*   **Zod Validation:** Use zod to validate the input and outputs of the tools to ensure data integrity.\n*   **Lucide Icons:** The implementation should use lucide icons to display the weather conditions in the UI. Make sure they are installed and configured correctly.\n\nThis implementation plan should provide a clear guide for another agent to code up the demo effectively. Let me know if you have any questions!\n",
  "readme": "# Tool Calling UI\n\nThis demo showcases a simple chatbot that uses tool calling to enhance its capabilities. It features a `getWeather` tool that returns a fake weather forecast and a `rollDice` tool that returns a random number between 1 and 6. The UI visualizes the tool responses, rendering the dice roll as a red die and the weather as an icon and temperature. The demo uses Genkit's tool calling, chat API, and custom UI rendering for tool outputs.\n\n## Things to Try\n\n- Ask for the weather in different locations and observe the weather icons displayed.\n- Ask the chatbot to roll a die and see the red die render in the UI.\n- Try combining prompts such as asking \"What's the weather like and then roll a die for me\" and observing the multiple tool calls.\n- Change the system message in the config section to change the behavior of the chatbot and see how that effects the results.",
