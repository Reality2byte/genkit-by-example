# Tool Calling Chatbot

This demo showcases a simple chatbot that utilizes Genkit's tool calling feature. The chatbot is capable of responding to user prompts by using two defined tools: `getWeather`, which simulates fetching weather data, and `rollDice`, which simulates rolling a six-sided die.

## Things to Try

- Ask the bot for the weather in a specific location.
- Ask the bot to roll a die.
- Combine requests, for example "What's the weather like, and then roll a die".
- Change the system message to influence the bot's behavior, for example "Roll a die each time before responding. If it's 1-3, talk like a pirate. If it's 4-6, talk like a 1950's scifi robot.".
