# Simple Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot using Genkit's non-persistent `Chat` interface.

You can customize the system instructions, and responses are streamed.
History is stored in-memory and passed to the server each time.

## Things to Try

- Send a message like "tell me a story"
- Reset the conversation
- Set the system message to `Talk like a pirate.`
